# Projects-Examples
This is a Repository for Exercises that challenge the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These files that are uploaded are ones that I have done, refactored and got out to be looked over, shared and given feedback on. Please let me know what you think that could be done differently and I hope that they help you as much as they have been helping me.
